## textacy: NLP, before and after spaCy

`textacy` is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library, `textacy` focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.
